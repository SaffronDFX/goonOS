# goonOS

This is the First Iteration of goonOS, an Operating System.

There's not really much to it, other than it opens in QEMU as a .bin file.
-----------------------

The intent is to make an OS that is lightweight, can be ran in a terminal, or can use a very basic window manager, if it progresses that far.

So far, the OS

-Boots as a .BIN file
- does not boot as an .ISO
