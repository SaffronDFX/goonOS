# goonOS

This is the First Iteration of goonOS, an Operating System.

There's not really much to it right now, but it's planned to be incredibly lightweight and accessible
-----------------------

The intent is to make an OS that is lightweight, can be ran in a terminal, or can use a very basic window manager, if it progresses that far.

So far, the OS

- Boots as a .BIN file
- ~~does not boot as an .ISO~~ Boots as an ISO as of Version 1.0.0


------
Rules on Version Releases.

example: GrolOS, ver. a.b.c

- 'a' notates the major update number 
- 'b' means the month it was compiled
- 'c' means that this version is the most recently created after an approved contribution.

example, a **4.10.7** release means that it's the 4th major update of the kernel, it was compiled in October, and that there were 7 approved contributions after Kernel Version 4.0.0
